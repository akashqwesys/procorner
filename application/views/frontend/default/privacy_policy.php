                            We acquire certain information directly from you, such as data you enter yourself, information about your content consumption, and data from third-party platforms you link to Procorner. We also collect some information automatically, such as information about your device and which parts of our Services you use, or how much time you spend on them. Private data, such as profile changes and bound databases, may be required for certain transactions. We will not sell, exchange, rent, or otherwise make personal data available to any third party for commercial purposes, and such data will only be used for the stated purpose. To achieve this goal, we may reveal the information to our employees, consultants, or other parties who have a genuine need to be forced to recognize the information.

                            We use cookies, which are minor text files stored on your computer by your browser, to collect, store, and share information about your activity across websites, including Procorner.

                            <br>
                            When you enter personal information, we see it as a valuable asset that must be safeguarded, and we utilize tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, and so on) to secure it from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no technique of internet transmission or method of computer storage is completely safe. As a result, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, nor can we guarantee that third parties will not unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or personal communications, or that other users will not abuse or misuse your personal information. As a result, while we make every effort to protect your information, we recommend you contact our Support Team for help.
