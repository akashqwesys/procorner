                            You'll need an account to do a lot of things on our platform, including getting and accessing content and submitting articles for publication. When creating and maintaining your account, you should provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, as well as a valid email address. You are solely responsible for your account and everything that occurs on it, as well as any harm caused by someone misusing your account without your consent. This means you should be cautious with your countersign. You will not give your account to another person or use another person's account. Before you may submit content for publication on Procorner, you'll need to verify your identity according to our Support Terms.

                            You approved to pay the charges for the content you recently purchased, and you permit us to charge those costs to your debit or Mastercard or another payment method (such as direct debit or mobile wallet). Procorner collaborates with payment service providers to provide you with the most convenient payment methods available in your country and to keep your payment information safe. We may alter your payment strategies based on information provided by our payment service providers. For further information, please see our Privacy Policy.

                            <br>
                            As a student or teacher, the content you submit (including courses) is yours to keep. By submitting courses and other content, you give Procorner permission to reprocess and disseminate it; however, you retain all ownership rights to your content. If you're a tutor, pay close attention to the material licensing terms that will be sent to you. The Institute maintains the right to make any changes to its programmes, venue, temporal arrangement, and category days with no prior notice to students or the general public. The decision of the Chairman and Managing Director will be final and binding on the scholars and the general public. The Examination Centre can be changed at any time based on the Institute's need, with no prior warning to the students/people. You authorize Procorner to use and share your content with anyone, distribute it and sell it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit when you post content, comments, questions, reviews.

                            <br>
                            If a disagreement arises, our Support Team will gladly assist you in resolving the issue. If that doesn't work your options are to go to small claims court or to file a claim in binding arbitration; you won't be able to file a claim in another court or a non-individual class action claim against us. Most problems can be resolved calmly without FIR, so before filing a formal legal case, please contact our Support Team first.
