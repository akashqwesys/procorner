                        If you opted for a payment plan, all payments must be completed. You may not cancel partway through. This is done to avoid fraud.

                        *Note: All refunds are discretionary. If you just downloaded the training material (pdfs, audios, videos, and/or etc), and then promptly asked for a refund, we reserve the right to deny your refund request.

                        The purpose of this policy is to allow individuals to attempt the framework, and on the off chance that it doesn't work, they can recover the amount they invested. It wasn't intended to allow individuals to take the preparation material and after that request a refund a couple of days later.

                        If you pay in full or choose the payment plan and then download the materials, see the videos and get the information, then there will be no refunds issued and you must complete the payment plan if you selected one.

                        If the payment plan is not completed on time, we will pursue it with a collection agency until the entire payment plan is made. Additional fees and fines might apply in this case.

                        Furthermore, if it is clear that your homework/ tasks are incomplete or that you did not implement the strategies taught in the course, your refund will be denied. However, we will still help and support you in order to get you results.
